      <h3>Needs from culture diversity</h3>
      <p>I have been business traveling across China in the past two years. I was happy to discover people treated the same physical and digital worlds in different ways: Everyone would adapt a service or mobile phone app to own needs. </p>
      <p>These needs arised from our daily life and were different per cultures. When a service or application is being designed, I feel thinking about how it can be incorporated into the life and culture diversity of its users is vital to the success. </p>

      <h3>Involvement of different mindsets</h3>
      <p>Every year ThoughtWorks arranges visits to under-developed and powerless areas. These visits are called “Personal Journey”: A path for us to understand how technology can bring impacts to the society and those in need.</p>
      <p>I believe this journey is also a quest for design: how design can change people’s life? I engaged my designer and software engineer colleagues in these visits. Through in-the-field research and co-design workshops, many ideas were sparked and developed among local people, NGO, software engineers and designers. Everyone involved was influencing each other’s mindset invisibly. </p>
      <p>These journeies helps me understand design impacts far greater than a final product. The progressive involvement of design is the first step towards changing people’s life.</p>

        <h3>A common language for teamwork</h3>
        <p>I'm always proud of the changing-world experience at Reuters: Team working world-widely with software engineers, designers, and product experts, we continuously re-designed and developed Reuters' news delivery products, which is a core business of Reuters News Agency since more than 150 years ago.</p>
        <p>For almost 10 years, I have always been working in such dynamic and cross-culture environments. The key to success is finding a common language to trade minds between design and technology.</p>

      <h3>A real prototype</h3>
      <p>Getting feedback from real users and refining the design is an infinite process. Designers usually create sketches, storyboards and prototypes to help people understand the design concept. </p>
      <p>There is another efficient way for such communication: Presenting a working prototype. I built mobile games with html5, mobile applications with framer.js and physical gadgets with arduino and intel edison. </p>
      <p>Consider a real life scenario: When you are at a restaurant and are going to order some food, there are menu, artifical food models, and a waitress bring real dishes to people who sits next to you. Which of above three will attract your attentions most? </p>
      <p>Seeing is believing. Being shown a storyboard, people will comment on the story. Being shown a working prototype, people will provide feedback about their experience of interacting with it. </p>
      <p>If we want to understand people’s real experience rather than simple reactions, we need to present an as real as possible design to them. </p>

      <h3>Technology inspires design</h3>
      <p>When working at engineering team, I did a lot of experiments with code: enhancing interaction effects with new frameworks and optimising existing code to make it compatible with more devices. </p>
      <p>During one hack day event at Reuters, my colleague and I designed and developed a new iPad application for our product, with real data coming from a re-configurated API. We were excited to see random experiments we made before transformed into this new design concept. </p>
      <p>With a proper catelyst, such as the hack day, explorations on technology can generate new design insights. </p>

      <h3>Infrastructure for innovation</h3>
      <p>I have been spending a lot of time with clients on experience design innovation this year. Putting both technology and design in mind is the correct way to delivery the best experience. </p>
      <p>We started from designing and building working prototypes and minimum viable products (MVP). During the process of building working prototypes, numbers of technologies and many forms of designs were explored to identify the best combination and meet customers’ needs.</p>
      <p>Through building MVPs, problems of current technical infrastucture were identified. Plans to upgrade were made and carried out. After several working prototypes and MVPs were successfully built, the technical infrastructure became robuster. Building more MVPs with it became faster. The innovation capability is establised.</p>
